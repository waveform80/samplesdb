            <p>Currently, the system is limited to academic users. This means
            that all e-mail addresses used during sign-up must end with
            <tt>.edu</tt> or <tt>.ac.<em>country</em></tt> (where country is
            something like <tt>uk</tt> or <tt>fr</tt>, etc.)</p>

            <p>Once the system is out of beta, we will extend it to permit
            paying users to sign-up with any e-mail address. For academic
            users, the system will always remain free.</p>

            <p>The <a href="${request.route_url('account_edit')}">edit account
              details</a> page will only let you remove an e-mail address if
            there is more than one <em>verified</em> address associated with
            your account. All accounts must have at least one verified address
            at all times (otherwise you wouldn't be able to login).</p>
