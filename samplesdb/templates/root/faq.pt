        <p>Currently, the system is limited to academic users. This means that
        all e-mail addresses used during sign-up must end with <tt>.edu</tt> or
        <tt>.ac.<em>country</em></tt> (where country is something like
        <tt>uk</tt> or <tt>fr</tt>, etc.)</p>

        <p>Once the system is out of beta, we will extend it to permit paying
        users to sign-up with any e-mail address. For academic users, the
        system will always remain free.</p>

        <p>The <a href="${request.route_url('account_edit')}">edit account
          details</a> page will only let you remove an e-mail address if there
        is more than one <em>verified</em> address associated with your
        account. All accounts must have at least one verified address at all
        times (otherwise you wouldn't be able to login).</p>
